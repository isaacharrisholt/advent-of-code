# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. They're grouped by year,
then by day.

I'll also try to set myself a challenge each year. You can read about my
challenges for each year below.

## 2022

In 2022, my aim is to solve the puzzles using a random programming language
each day. The language will be generated by a generator based on the list used
for [this](https://perchance.org/programming-languge) project.

Some languages have been added or removed based on my own preferences as well
as the flexibility of the language. For example, I've removed CSS because it's
not Turing complete without a preprocessor and HTML, and MATLAB because it's
paid.

If I am unable to complete a puzzle in a language, I will instead try to solve
it in another language.

| 3   | [Ladder Logic](./2022/day_3) | Ladder Logic doesn't have great support for text manipulation.<br>Completed day 3 in Python                                                                                                                                                              |

| 5   | [AutoIt](./2022/day_5)       | I missed quite a few days due to other engagements, so I completed the next few in Python to get them done on the same day                                                                                                                               |
| 6   | [ABAP](./2022/day_6)         | Completed in Python                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7   | [Lua](./2022/day_7)          | Completed in Python. I really enjoyed this challenge, though!                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 8   | [Ada](./2022/day_8)          | Completed in Python. This one caused me more trouble than I care to admit!                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 9   | [CoffeeScript](./2022/day_9) | Completed in Python. I actually found part 2 of this one quite difficult! Got there in the end though, with the help of a handy debug renderer                                                                                                           |
| 10  | [Objective-C](./2022/day_10) | Completed in Python. I really enjoyed this one! I thought the concept was really interesting.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 11  | [Prolog](./2022/day_10)      | Completed in Python. This was really, really tricky to get part 2. I eventually read about [the congruence modulo](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/congruence-modulo) and got it figured out though. |
| 12  | [C#](./2022/day_12)          | I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do any new languages. This one took me a few goes, and I tried a DFS and A* before trying BFS. I left my A* attempt in the repo for funsies!                                                                        |
| 13  | [Rust](./2022/day_13)        | I'm learning Rust at the moment, so I would have <em>loved</em> to do it in Rust, but I didn't have much time. I found it quite simple in Python, and would like to try re-implementing in Rust in the future.                                           |
